# PEPhub organizations

PEPhub allows users to create and manage PEPs within an organization. PEPhub organizations are linked to GitHub 
organizations, and all members of a linked GitHub organization are designated as admins for the projects in the 
corresponding PEPhub organization. By default, all projects in a PEPhub organization are public. However, admins 
can make projects private, restricting visibility to members of the organization.

### Logging in
When you log in to PEPhub through GitHub, all your organizations are fetched, and you are automatically added as an admin.

!!! warning "Warning!"
    PEPhub currently does not support GitHub user organizations that are set to private (hidden) in the user settings.

!!! tip "Set GitHub org Membership Visibility"

    1. Go to the GitHub page.
    2. Navigate to the organizationâ€™s page. (e.g. https://github.com/databio)
    3. Click People (in the organization's menu bar).
    4. Locate your username and ensure your membership is public.![../img/github_orgs.png](../img/github_orgs.png)
