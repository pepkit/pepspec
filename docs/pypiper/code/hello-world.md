# Hello world

This brief tutorial will run your first basic pypiper pipeline to ensure you have everything set up correctly. 

Just run these 3 lines of code and you're running your first pypiper pipeline!

### Install the latest version of pypiper

```{console}
pip install --user piper
```


### Download hello_pypiper.py
```{console}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databio/pypiper/master/example_pipelines/hello_pypiper.py
```

This is a basic pipeline. Here are the contents:


```bash
cat ../example_pipelines/hello_pypiper.py
```

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    import pypiper
    outfolder = "hello_pypiper_results" # Choose a folder for your results
    
    # Create a PipelineManager, the workhorse of pypiper
    pm = pypiper.PipelineManager(name="hello_pypiper", outfolder=outfolder)
    
    # Timestamps to delineate pipeline sections are easy:
    pm.timestamp("Hello!")
    
    # Now build a command-line command however you like, and pass it to pm.run()
    target_file = "hello_pypiper_results/output.txt"
    cmd = "echo 'Hello, Pypiper!' > " + target_file
    pm.run(cmd, target_file)
    
    pm.stop_pipeline()


### Run it!


```bash
python3 ../example_pipelines/hello_pypiper.py
```

This output is printed to your screen and also recorded in a log file (called ``hello_pypiper_log.md``). There are a few other outputs from the pipeline as well. All results are placed in a folder called ``hello_pypiper_results``. Navigate to that folder to observe the output of the pipeline, which will include these files:

 * hello_pypiper_commands.sh
 * hello_pypiper_completed.flag
 * hello_pypiper_log.md
 * hello_pypiper_profile.tsv
 * output.txt
 * stats.tsv

These files are explained in more detail in the reference section [outputs explained](outputs). 

What's next? That depends on if you're interested in just *running* pypiper pipelines, or if you want to *develop* pypiper pipelines. The next sections are a series of HOW-TO articles that address each of these scenarios.
