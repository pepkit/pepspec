# Tutorial conclusion

## Recap

We've come to the end of the basic tutorial.
Starting from a basic looper workspace, we walked through how to add successively more powerful features.
You learned how to use PEP for metadata management beyond a simple CSV.
You learned how to use pipestat to help you with powerful result reports and job monitoring.
You learned how to use divvy to submit your jobs to use different compute resources.

One key takeaway from this should be how modular everything is.
Each of the more powerful features is an option. 
You don't have to use any of them if you don't want to.
You can also use all of them simultaneously if you need it.
You can also use each of these tools independent of looper in a completely different system.

That modularity is the core design philosophy of PEPkit. 

What we've covered so far is still just the beginning of what you can use these tools to do. 
In the advanced user guides, you'll find details on how to configure run options, more advanced computing guides, and more useful metadata management.
There are also how-to guides with specific recipes for common use cases.
So at this point, it's probably best to just dive in and then consult the more advanced documentation when you find yourself wanting to do something specific.

Good luck!
