# Installing

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- pip (usually included with Python)

## Install with pip

```console
pip install looper
```

## Verify installation

```console
looper --version
```

You should see output showing the installed version, e.g. `looper 2.0.0`.

## Update

```console
pip install --upgrade looper
```

## Troubleshooting

If the `looper` executable is not automatically in your `$PATH`, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.profile`:

```console
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
```

Alternatively, you can install from [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/pepkit/looper/releases).
