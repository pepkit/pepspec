# Learn append sample modifier in `peppy`

This vignette will show you how and why to use the append functionality of the `pepr` package. 

 - basic information about this concept on the [specification website](http://pep.databio.org/en/2.0.0/specification/#sample_modifiersappend).

## Problem/Goal
The example below demonstrates how to use the constant attributes to **define the samples attributes in the `read_type` column** of the `sample_table.csv` file. This functionality is extremely useful when there are many samples that are characterized by identical values of certain attribute (here: value `SINGLE` in `read_type` attribute). Please consider the example below for reference:


```python
examples_dir = "../tests/data/example_peps-cfg2/example_append/"
sample_table_ori = examples_dir + "sample_table_pre.csv"
%cat $sample_table_ori | column -t -s, | cat
```

    sample_name  organism  time  read_type
    pig_0h       pig       0     SINGLE
    pig_1h       pig       1     SINGLE
    frog_0h      frog      0     SINGLE
    frog_1h      frog      1     SINGLE


## Solution
As the name suggests the attributes in the specified attributes (here: `read_type`) can be defined as constant ones. The way how this process is carried out is indicated explicitly in the `project_config.yaml` file (presented below). The name of the column is determined in the `sample_modifiers.append` key-value pair. Note that definition of more than one constant attribute is possible.



```python
project_config_file = examples_dir + "project_config.yaml"
%cat $project_config_file
```

    pep_version: "2.0.0"
    sample_table: sample_table.csv
    
    sample_modifiers:
      append:
        read_type: SINGLE
    


Let's introduce a few modifications to the original `sample_table.csv` file to use the `sample_modifiers.append` section of the config. Simply skip the attributes that are set constant and let the `pepr` do the work for you.


```python
sample_table = examples_dir + "sample_table.csv"
%cat $sample_table | column -t -s, | cat
```

    sample_name  organism  time 
    pig_0h       pig       0
    pig_1h       pig       1
    frog_0h      frog      0
    frog_1h      frog      1


## Code
Import `peppy` and read in the project metadata by specifying the path to the `project_config.yaml`:


```python
from peppy import Project
p = Project(project_config_file)
```

And inspect it:


```python
print(p)
p.sample_table
```

    Project 'example_append' (/Users/mstolarczyk/Uczelnia/UVA/code/peppy/tests/data/example_peps-cfg2/example_append/project_config.yaml)
    4 samples: pig_0h, pig_1h, frog_0h, frog_1h
    Sections: pep_version, sample_table, sample_modifiers

As you can see, the resulting samples are annotated the same way as if they were read from the original annotations file with attributes in the last column manually determined.
