# How to create a PEP from GEO or SRA

`geofetch` is a command-line utility that converts GEO or SRA accessions into PEP projects. You provide an accession (or a spreadsheet with a list of accessions), and `geofetch` with produce the PEP (both project config and sample annotation). `geofetch` can also download the data from SRA, so your project will be ready for direct input into any PEP-compatible tool.

For more information, see [`geofetch` user documentation and vignettes](/geofetch)
